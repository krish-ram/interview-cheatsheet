How do you find out the lightest stone from 9 similar looking stones in the shortest number of steps
Ans: Divide the 9 balls into 3 groups of 3. Compare the weight of two of those groups. 

The heavier group should then be obvious, it will either tip the scales, or, if the scales stay balanced, then it is the group you didn't include.

Now, choose 2 balls from this group and compare their weights, and using the same logic as before, the heavier ball will be obvious.
